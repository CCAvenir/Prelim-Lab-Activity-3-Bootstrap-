          <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
            Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter, known for his vivid colors, emotional depth, and bold brushwork. 
            Despite creating over 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, he was virtually unknown during his lifetime and struggled with mental illness. 
            Today, van Gogh is one of the most influential figures in the history of Western art.

            moving through periods of realism, impressionism, and a final, signature post-impressionistic style.
